      - Reading and exporting MS Access mdb online
    genericName: R + Shiny app
    localisedName: Rmdbvis
    longDescription: |
      Rmdbvis is a Shiny script written in R which allows the user to upload a MS Access db to the organization's server and allows the user to choose one table from the db, 
      viewing it online and exporting it to a .csv file or directly to memory. With a simple customisation, it allows the user to directly write the table to a personal Gdrive.
      In such a case some lines of code must be edited along with the Google secrets to access the organization's Drive. Just substitute the XXXX with your secrets. Have a look at README.md for more details.
